Autumn is here, so it seems fitting to resurrect from my archives the review I wrote of the [Pumpking Potion](http://www.adagio.uk.com/signature_blend/blend.html?blend=7569) tea, from the [Magic Potions](http://www.adagio.uk.com/signature_blend/group.html?group=23) signature blends collection from [Adagio Teas](http://adagioteas.tumblr.com/).

Before reading the Harry Potter books, I didn't even know that pumpking beverages could be a thing, therefore I was very curious to try this tea.

When dry, this blend has a very subtle smell, which turns into an only slightly stronger one when you brew it. The tea doesn't actually smell like pumpkin (thankfully, I should say: I like pumpking, but I think it has an overpowering smell that I find slightly sickening).

The tea has a very sweet, almost sugary taste which is really nice. The pumpking note is very subtle, but it lingers in your mouth while you drink and, in my opinion, it is just the right balance.

While drinking this tea, I could feel all the various spices and fruity aromas, especially cinnamon and vanilla, but I couldn't actually feel much of the tea, so, this blend makes for a nice, fruity, sweet hot beverage, but may not be the best if you are a tea purist.

As I mentioned, this brew is very sweet by itself, so I don't think it needs to be sweetened, though it might be interesting to try it with almond milk.

I don't add any milk or sweeteners to my teas, and this one was really sweet already by itself.

I think this makes a nice sweet treat after dinner or in the morning, and it seems like the kind of hot beverages that kids will love.
