10 minutes sketch, done with pencils on parchment paper.

I mentioned in my [previous post](http://melyanna.github.io/2016-02-09-elf/), that I wanted to leave my comfort zone, draw something different, and also exercise a little bit.
I also decided, right after posting that picture, that I should start with the drawing exercises sooner rather than later.
So I went to [/r/SketchDaily](https://www.reddit.com/r/SketchDaily/comments/44vtan/february_9th_roses/) and found the prompt "Roses", and here is the result.
