<img src="/img/03072016/chelseat.jpg" alt="Chelsea stadium" align="left" style="PADDING-RIGHT: 15px; padding-bottom: 15px;"/> It's been quite some time since my last update, and I feel a little guilty for temporarily abandoning this blog.
I have many things to do and little energy to do them and I had to go on a work trip last week, which didn't really help, so all of my projects ended up being on hold.


On the positive side, I had a really good time in London (for a business trip anyway): I met some really nice people and I just love the place anyway.
I took the picture in this post during my trip and you can see that my job does take me to interesting places, even though I couldn't care less about football.


Here is a list of things I am working on; let's see if writing them here helps me find my motivation again:

* Continue my Python course on [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/Melyanna).
* Finish my Twine projects (and start one in English that I can share with more people).
* Resume my daily sketches. Now that I have a tablet I can sketch on the train more easily.
* Write that article about the creepy Polish video.
* Re-arrange the file structure of this blog, and update old posts accordingly.
* Finish "Life is Strange" (Awesome game)
* Cleanup my inbox.
* Set up the conferences and meetings for the skeptics association I am involved with.

The last two items on the list are actually the more important ones, and I really need to focus on those right now.
And, in addition to all that stuff, I still want to go back to running and to healthier life habits.


I am sorry for the very personal, very random ramblings, but I really wanted to write something that would at least get me to update this blog, and remove one item from the above list.
