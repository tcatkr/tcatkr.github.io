So... I made a thing.

I've been trying to do this thing for a while now, but never had the time to sit down and think of how I wanted the thing to look like and what kind of content it should have.

But I've finally done it, and here it, behold my new Jekyll/Github blog!

The blog uses the <a href="http://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/">Beautiful Jekyll</a> theme by <a href="http://deanattali.com/">Dean Attali</a>, and I love it so far because it's simple, clean and very readable.

I've already customized it a little bit, but more changes will come in the future if this thing takes off and I manage to keep working on it.

In the meanwhile, enjoy my blog-thing if you happen to stop by and read this.
